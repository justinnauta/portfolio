# Justin Nauta's Web Portfolio
This website serves as a source of professional information about myself, including my resume and projects I have done.

## My Role

Sole Developer (The entirety of the website was developed by me)

## Technologies

Vue • Bulma • SASS • Adobe XD

## Difficulties

After most of the website was completed I was left with a good number of bugs to fix. It was intimidating at first because I knew it would take a while to get through them. I would need a way of organizing them all and a plan to fix them.

## Solution

I started by thoroughly testing the website myself, as well as asking others to test it. From there I compiled a list of all the bugs ranked by severity. I then split up the bugs into chunks and allocated time to work through each chunk. Because of this I was able to efficiently fix all the (known) bugs.

## Notable Features

The navbar is unique/atypical. Typically, navbars will be seen at the top of the page and stick there. My portfolio’s navbar starts at the bottom of the first section, and then sticks to the top once you scroll passed it. This was a little more of a challenge to implement than a basic navbar.
